Syrius / John recapped on where they were.
Syrius rebuilt the spinny scanner on a leonardo.
John got some visuals from the data by eating the CSV.
We determined that the ultrasonic sensor only works well on perpindicular scans. After about 30 degrees off perp, readings are way off. So... can't do the room scanning thing.

Will probably move forward with controlling two brush motors.
Kris might print a car with two wheels.
Need to look into on the fly calibrated light sensors? Or at least play with light sensors?
