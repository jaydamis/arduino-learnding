Tested out ultrasonic sensor (Part# HC-SR0). Both input and output pins need to be put on regular I/O pins, not anaglog. 
Erected a metal frame to create a foundation for the servo and raise up the Ultra Sonic sensor above.
John combined the servo code with the ultra sonic code and we tested in the kitechen on the 3x3 tile facing the washer and oven.
John learned how to write the output of Ultra sonic sensor to a file that will be used to create a shape.
Each degree is tied to an output.

Next Week: Draw the object with the values outputted from the ultra sonic sensor.
Move parts onto a single board.

Down the line: Use DC motors to power the wheels.
